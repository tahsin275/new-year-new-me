                        Looking back on my previous year, I recognize my
                        failures and the missed opportunities that came with
                        them. However, I also understand that I can learn from
                        these setbacks and use them as motivation to do better
                        in the new year. Rather than dwelling on past failures,
                        I will focus on using the lessons I've learned to
                        achieve my goals and reach new heights.
